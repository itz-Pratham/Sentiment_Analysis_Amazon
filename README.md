# 🛍️ Amazon Review Sentiment Analyzer

A machine learning project that analyzes customer reviews from the Amazon Alexa dataset to predict sentiment (positive or negative). The project leverages a pipeline approach with **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** for efficient preprocessing and classification.

## 📌 Features

* Preprocessing of textual review data.
* Sentiment classification using a scikit-learn pipeline.
* TF-IDF feature extraction.
* Logistic Regression model for sentiment prediction.
* Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.
* Jupyter Notebook for training and visualization.
* Optional Streamlit web app (if applicable in future).

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used is the [Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/furiousx7/amazon-alexa-reviews), which contains:

* `verified_reviews`: Customer review text
* `feedback`: Target variable (1 = positive, 0 = negative)
